# Note Taker 2000

## Description

This project was my first opportunity to connect a front-end javascript application to a back-end server. 

Throughout this project, I enhanced my understanding of API routes using the express.js router function. I also learned how to create a UUID and store JSON data to a persistent file. A secondary benefit of this project is a deeper understanding of promises and how to leverage helper functions/utilities to simplify the readability of my code.

Upon clicking the button, the app will display any of the notes that have previously been saved to the JSON file. Click the + icon to create a new note, then enter a title and description. Once both fields are populated, the application will present a save icon to save your note data to the JSON file.

## Credits

This project would have been near impossible for me to create from scratch given my skillset at the time of initial completion. I heavily leveraged the code base from the DU coding bootcamp's express.js mini project. 

The solved code from that assignment combined with the starter code given for this application taught me a ton about how I could be structuring my code better. It also introduced me to new node packages that I wouldn't have otherwise been aware of.
